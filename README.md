Character-Level RNN for Text Classification: This project trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify text sequences into predefined categories, using character-level input and one-hot encoding for sequence processing.

Performance Evaluation with Confusion Matrix: The model's performance is visualized through a confusion matrix, which tracks the accuracy and common misclassifications across different categories, helping to assess the model's strengths and weaknesses.
